# Comment System
A simple comment system written in php

The *"program"* needs to be in a subdirectory. But it should be able to be 
called anything

## IMPORTANT
There is a file called ``database.ini``, it contains the access keys to the 
database. It should NOT be possibly to lock at this file for the user. 
Block the user from doing this, in any way you seem fit (but it's preferable if
the user doesn't get (to) hurt).
